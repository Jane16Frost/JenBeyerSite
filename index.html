        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Jennifer is a settler of European decent, grateful to make her home in Treaty 6 territory, a traditional gathering place for diverse Indigenous Peoples including the Cree, Blackfoot, Nakota Sioux, Iroquois, Dene, Ojibway/Saulteaux/ Anishinaabe, MÃ©tis, Inuit, and many others including Metis Nation of Alberta Region 4. She values the histories, languages, and cultures that continue to enrich our vibrant communities and every opportunity to support Truth and Reconciliation and cultivate her understanding of being a Treaty person.</p>

        <h1>Meet Jen Beyer</h1>
        <h2>Consulting</h2>
        <p>Jennifer Beyer is a dynamic, dedicated and passionate engagement and collaborative decision-making practitioner with more than two decades of experience in community development, group facilitation, the non-profit sector, leadership, and citizen and stakeholder consultation.</p>
        <h2>Personable communication</h2>
        <p>Jen believes we can tackle the wicked problems we face in organizations and communities through transformed workplace culture, public policy development, and service delivery informed by real dialogue that engages everyone, particularly equity-deserving people, and true allyship with Indigenous Peoples. She has been making a real effort to understand unconscious bias, intersectionality, power, and privilege and how it plays out in teams, communities, systems, and institutions, and to integrate this awareness into her work.</p>
        <h2>Diversity Advocate</h2>
        <p>Through her diverse experiences, Jen has cultivated strong communication and relationship building skills that allow her to work collaboratively with almost anyone. She can create safe spaces for diverse groups where challenging conversations can happen productively on complex issues. Combining her genuine care for others and her willingness to embrace the messiness of human experience and relationship, her work is people-centered and balances participant expectations and needs with project objectives.</p>
